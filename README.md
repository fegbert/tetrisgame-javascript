# tetrisgame-javascript

Tetrisgame is a very simple Tetris clone, which I made to learn some javascript.
I made it alot easier for myself by using the p5.js library, which makes it a lot easier
to display and animate graphics.

# made using p5.js
p5.js is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible
and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! p5.js is free
and open-source because we believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone.
